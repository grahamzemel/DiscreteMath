I'll likely add to this repository as I learn more about discrete math. I'm currently taking a course on it, and I'm finding it very interesting. Here are a few topics I'll be adding in the future as I learn about them:
- Graph Theory
- Combinatorics
- Number Theory
- Set Theory
- Logic
- Probability
- Game Theory
- Cryptography
- Information Theory
- Chaos Theory
- Cellular Automata
- Turing Machines
- Computability Theory
- Algorithms
